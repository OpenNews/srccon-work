<h2 class="leader">If we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work.</h2>

Thank you SRCCON:WORK attendees for two days of care, community, and collaboration.

If you’d like to revisit our talks, check out [our talk transcriptions](/transcription). We’ll also be publishing session write-ups and guides [over on Source](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srcconwork/) over the next few months.

## What is SRCCON:WORK?

SRCCON:WORK explored how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This new, two-day event took place Dec. 7-8, 2017, in Philadelphia, building on conversations emerging from SRCCON, our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each year to take on ideas that push newsrooms forward.

Many of the biggest problems we face aren’t technical at all, so the program at SRCCON:WORK took a deeper look at these themes:

* **Thursday AM: Hiring & Career Growth**
* **Thursday PM: Mental Health & Self-care**
* **Friday AM: Collaboration & Teamwork**
* **Friday PM: What Comes Next**

Here’s more about [how we organized the program at SRCCON:WORK](/program) and the [talks and sessions](/schedule).
