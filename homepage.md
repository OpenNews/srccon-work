<h2 class="leader">If we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work.</h2>

<a class="btn" id="attend-button" href="/tickets/attendance_form">Tell Us If You'd Like To Attend!</a> SRCCON:WORK is built around two days of [talks, discussions and hands-on workshops](/program) on how we shape newsroom culture to be more inclusive and collaborative. The conferences will take place December 7 & 8 at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia.

Instead of a ticket lottery, we have a short questionnaire for you to tell us why you'd like to attend SRCCON:WORK. The form is open through October 18. After that, we will review entries and notify everyone before the end of October. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket for $195, plus fees.

## What is SRCCON:WORK?

SRCCON:WORK will explore how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This new, two-day event builds on conversations emerging from [SRCCON](https://srccon.org), our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each summer to take on the cultural and technical ideas that push newsrooms forward. Many of the biggest problems we face aren’t technical at all, so our program will focus on three big themes:
    
    - **Collaboration & teamwork**: developing strategies to manage and mentor each other, and build happy, functional teams that communicate and coordinate across newsrooms.
    - **Hiring & career growth**: bringing in diverse, skilled voices and making newsrooms a place they want to stay.
    - **Mental health & self-care**: staying healthy—as individuals and as a community—so that even when the work gets hard, we don’t lose sight of the meaning we find in it.

Here’s more about [how the program will work at SRCCON:WORK](/program) and the [talks](/talks) and [sessions](/sessions) we've confirmed so far.
