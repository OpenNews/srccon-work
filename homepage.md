<h2 class="leader">If we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work.</h2>

SRCCON:WORK is built around two days of peer-led discussions and hands-on workshops on how we shape newsroom culture to be more inclusive and collaborative.

**[The sessions list is now live!](/sessions)** 

## Details about tickets

Instead of a ticket lottery, we will open a form on October 11 with a few questions for you to tell us why you'd like to attend SRCCON:WORK. We'll send out invitations to attend in mid-October.  We’re doing this so we can focus on participants who are most affected by [the issues we're covering](/sessions) and are seeking to make a change in their career or their workplace. Tickets will be $195. You can read more about why we’re using this new process [on our blog](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-work-tickets/).

## Attendee scholarships

We are also partnering with the News Integrity Initiative to provide [Diversity Scholarships](/scholarships) for journalists of color to attend SRCCON:WORK. We will also have a small number of scholarships for facilitators and white journalists from local and regional news organizations. The scholarship application will be part of the form to tell us why you'd like to attend SRCCON:WORK.

## When, where, and other logistics

SRCCON:WORK will take place on December 7 & 8 at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia. You can find more info on lodging, childcare support, live transcriptions, and other info on our [logistics page](/logistics).

## What is SRCCON:WORK?

SRCCON:WORK explores how we as a community can help each other take on the hard work of journalism. This new, two-day event builds on conversations emerging from [SRCCON](https://srccon.org), our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each summer to take on the cultural and technical ideas that push newsrooms forward.

Our program has collaboration at its heart, with sessions proposed and led by community members, and a schedule built to support them. SRCCON:WORK is also intentionally small, designed to create spaces that bring us all together and room to meet new colleagues. This event will have a lot in common with SRCCON, but add a few new things as well. 

## What's next?

We'll have more to share as we get closer to SRCCON:WORK. Stay in touch by following [@srccon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/srccon) or [signing up for our mailing list](http://opennews.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=71c95e9a43708843d2fdc1f09&id=996e9290cc).
