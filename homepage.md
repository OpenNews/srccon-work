SRCCON:WORK Attendees, welcome to Philly!

We are so glad to have you here with us. If you need logistics info, [we have you covered](/logistics) and of course the handy, mobile-friendly [schedule app](http://schedule.work.srccon.org) is available for all your session planning needs. The registration desk in the lobby will be staffed throughout the event, and our safety and support helpline is **(612) 584-1131**.

## What is SRCCON:WORK?

SRCCON:WORK will explore how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This new, two-day event builds on conversations emerging from SRCCON, our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each year to take on ideas that push newsrooms forward.

Many of the biggest problems we face aren’t technical at all, so the program at SRCCON:WORK will take a deeper look at these themes:

* **Thursday AM: Hiring & Career Growth**
* **Thursday PM: Mental Health & Self-care**
* **Friday AM: Collaboration & Teamwork**
* **Friday PM: What Comes Next**

Here’s more about [how we're organizing the program at SRCCON:WORK](/program) and the [talks and sessions](/schedule) we have in store.
