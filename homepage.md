<h2 class="leader">If we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work.</h2>

SRCCON:WORK is coming up at the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia on December 7-8. We have a slate of talks planned on careers, teamwork, and care along with collaborative sessions that dig into the themes.

**[The schedule is now live!](/schedule)**

If you're preparing to attend, we have a bunch of details on the [logistics page](/logistics). You can also hear from our speakers, who [chatted with Source](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srcconwork-q-a_1/) about their work and what they'll be sharing with us.

## What is SRCCON:WORK?

SRCCON:WORK will explore how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This new, two-day event builds on conversations emerging from SRCCON, our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each year to take on ideas that push newsrooms forward.

Many of the biggest problems we face aren’t technical at all, so the program at SRCCON:WORK will take a deeper look at these themes:

* **Thursday AM: Hiring & Career Growth**
* **Thursday PM: Mental Health & Self-care**
* **Friday AM: Collaboration & Teamwork**
* **Friday PM: What Comes Next**

Here’s more about [how we're organizing the program at SRCCON:WORK](/program) and the [talks](/talks) and [sessions](/sessions) we have in store.
