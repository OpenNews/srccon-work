We can't wait to hear about your idea for SRCCON:WORK! This event will explore ways our community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. We're inviting proposals on three important themes:

* **Collaboration & teamwork.** Let’s share strategies that help us manage and mentor each other, and develop happy, functional teams that communicate and coordinate across newsrooms.
* **Hiring & career growth.** We have so much to learn about helping technical journalists build meaningful careers, and bringing in diverse, skilled voices and making newsrooms a place they want to stay.
* **Mental health & self-care.** We’re living in tough times for journalism right now. Let’s talk about how to stay healthy so that even when the work gets hard, we don’t lose sight of the meaning we find in it.

We'd love to have you help us bring these topics to the program through guided discussions or project-driven sessions. After we give your proposal an initial read, we'll publish the title and description on the [our proposals list](/sessions/proposals). If you're thinking about pitching a SRCCON:WORK session, we highly recommend reading through [this guide to crafting a great proposal](/sessions/proposals/guide). Or if you're all set, the proposal form is below!
