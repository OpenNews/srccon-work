## Schedule

**Dates:** December 7 & 8

We'll release the full schedule soon, but we can give you a glimpse now. Registration for SRCCON:WORK will open at 8:30am on Thursday, December 7 along with a welcome breakfast. The event will officially begin at 9:30am. The conference day will wrap around 6pm on Thursday, with group dinner plans (details soon!). We'll start up again with breakfast at 9am on Friday, December 8 and close SRCCON:WORK around 6pm.
