## Venue

SRCCON:WORK will take place at the [Chemical Heritage Foundation](http://www.chemheritage.org/), a museum and event space in the Old City neighborhood of Philadelphia.

## Schedule

**Dates:** December 7 & 8

We're still finalizing details, but your travel plans can anticipate the SRCCON:WORK program beginning around 9am on Thursday, Dec. 7, and closing around 6pm on Friday, Dec. 8.

## Hotel

We have a discounted block of rooms at the Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District Hotel a few blocks from the conference venue. The nightly rate will be $179 plus taxes. 

You can use [this link](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/groups/hr/srccon-work) to book a room at the discounted rate or call the hotel directly and tell them you're with SRCCON:WORK.

## Childcare

We want SRCCON:WORK to be as accessible as possible, including to parents! Given the smaller size of this event, we're exploring options for what kind of childcare support we may be able to provide. 

Please [let us know](mailto:erika@opennews.org) if childcare would help you participate in SRCCON:WORK. We'll have more details in a few weeks.

## Transcription

Once again, we'll have live transcription for SRCCON:WORK from our friends at White Coat Captioning. As we get closer to the event, we'll have more details about what role transcription will play in this event. 

## Coming soon

We'll keep updating this page with more details about what to expect before and during SRCCON:WORK. Stay tuned!
