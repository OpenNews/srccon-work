If you’re coming on the blue (Market-Frankford) line, you’ll want the 2nd St Station, go one block south to Chestnut and a block and a half west (a smidge past 3rd).

The wheelchair-accessible pedestrian gate is available at the parking-lot entrance on 3rd Street between Chestnut and Market Streets. The pedestrian gate will be unlocked. If you’re traveling by car, drive up to the parking-lot gate, which will open automatically during regular business hours and events. You may park in any open spot marked “Visitor” or in one of two spots reserved for those with disabilities.

The closest subway station to the conference hotel and venue is [5th Street Independence Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/Z6xmt8m5c7E2) on the Market-Frankford Line (also known as “the El” or “blue line”). You can buy a [refillable Key Card](http://www.septa.org/fares/pass/key.html) from kiosks at stations, or even single-ride tokens at some stations as well.

From the airport, you can get to Old City by regional rail train. [Take the Airport Line to the Jefferson Station](https://goo.gl/maps/Q2D8TiDEW322), then walk a block to the 11st Street Station and take the blue line to 5th Street Independence Hall (or just walk about 8 blocks to the hotel or conference venue). A one-way fare on the Airport Line is $6.75.

For those coming from the train, the blue line station is just south of the station across Market Street.

Numerous bus lines also run on Market Street, which is one block north of the venue. In addition to public transit, the Old City area is exceptionally walkable and cabs are plentiful.
