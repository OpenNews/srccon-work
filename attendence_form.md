Tell us about what interests you in attending SRCCON:WORK! We'll send out invitations to attend in mid- to late October. If invited, you'll be able to purchase a single, non-transferrable ticket for $195, plus ticket fees.

This same form is where you apply for a [travel scholarship](/scholarships) to SRCCON:WORK. Please check the corresponding box on this form to open up the scholarship application.
