SRCCON:WORK is an intentionally small event, but we also care about getting the ideas and conversations that take place there into the wider world. The most important way this happens is when attendees return home and put their new skills and approaches to work, but we also document extensively.

## Transcription

Our captioner will provide live transcription of all our talks at SRCCON:WORK, and links to the archives will remain below. We'll also transcribe several sessions for publication later on.

{% endfor %}
    </table>
