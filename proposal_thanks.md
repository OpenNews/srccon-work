## Thank you for submitting a proposal to SRCCON:WORK!

We read through every session idea soon after it comes in, and we'll publish yours on the [SRCCON:WORK proposals page](/sessions/proposals) soon. If you like, you can [submit another session proposal](/sessions/proposals/pitch) right now. If you're all set, please consider inviting friends and colleagues to submit proposals and join us in Philadelphia on December 7 & 8. Between now and then, here are a couple of key dates in the SRCCON:WORK session review process:

* The call for proposals closes at 11:59pm ET, **Monday, Sept. 18**.
* We'll notify all proposers about the status of their sessions by **Wednesday, Sept. 27**.

**Reminder:**  Because SRCCON:WORK is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, we ask that all participants purchase a ticket. The facilitators of all accepted sessions will be given an opportunity to purchase their ticket before attendee sales.
