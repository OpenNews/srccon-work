The SRCCON:WORK ticketing questionnaire is now closed. Invitations to SRCCON:WORK will go out at the end of October, scholarship recipients will recieve their notifications at the same time.

## The SRCCON:WORK tickets process

At about 100 people, we’re keeping the size of SRCCON:WORK small so that participants can really get to know each other and collaborate on ideas. This more intimate format means that we have to be even more intentional about equitably distributing tickets. We’re focusing on participants who are seeking to make a change in their career or their workplace.

By focusing on practitioners whose work is most affected by the themes we’re tackling, we hope that SRCCON:WORK can be an incubator for long-term projects and ideas that people can take back to nurture more inclusive, responsive spaces in their newsrooms.

The form is now closed, we are reviewing entries and will notify everyone before the end of October. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket for $195, plus fees.

## Financial assistance

We offer a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. To apply for a scholarship to SRCCON:WORK, just answer a few extra questions on the form.

## Volunteering

If you aren’t a part of our core audience but would like to see how we run SRCCON events, we need [volunteers](/volunteer) who can help us make this event a succcess.

## Sponsor tickets

If you're unable to get a ticket via the form and your organization is able to become a SRCCON:WORK sponsor, each level of sponsorship has tickets available, either as a part of the sponsorship package or held for reserved purchase. We offer a full rundown of available packages on [our sponsor page](/sponsors).
