            <p>SRCCON:WORK will explore how we as a community can make journalism more inclusive, representative, and responsive. This new, two-day event builds on conversations emerging from SRCCON, our hands-on conference that gathers members of the news-code community each year to take on ideas that push newsrooms forward.</p>

<h2 id="schedule-overview">Schedule Overview</h2>

<p>Each part of <a href="/schedule">the schedule</a> will begin with a pair ot 10-minute talks before breaking into collaborative sessions digging into their themes.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thursday AM: Hiring &amp; Career Growth.</strong> Our communities deserve coverage that brings in representative voices and makes newsrooms a place they want to stay.</li>
  <li><strong>Thursday PM: Mental Health &amp; Self-care.</strong> Let’s talk about staying healthy—as individuals and as a community—so that even when the work gets hard, we don’t lose sight of the meaning we find in it.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday AM: Collaboration &amp; Teamwork.</strong> We’ll share strategies to manage and mentor each other, and build happy, functional teams that communicate and coordinate across organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday PM: What Comes Next.</strong> Let’s get ready to go home and change newsroom culture. This is where the work starts, not ends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-schedule-that-respects-community">A Schedule That Respects Community</h2>

<p>SRCCON:WORK is organized around shared experiences and making connections. We’ve organized <a href="/schedule">the schedule</a> so that we can collaborate and build on each others’ ideas.</p>

<p>We’ve built in generous breaks so that you can continue conversations without rushing to the next thing. Lunch as a group provides for space to chill out, spend time with distant friends, or find conversations around emergent topics. Dinner on Thursday evening will give you a chance to connect with people wrestling with the same problems you are.</p>

<p>We want SRCCON:WORK to feel less like a small conference and more like a big cohort. We hope you’ll find new colleagues, champions, collaborators in every space and leave SRCCON:WORK with new ideas <em>and</em> new relationships, so when you take on the work of bringing change to your newsroom, you know you have a community supporting you as you make change happen.</p>

<h2 id="about-our-talks">About Our Talks</h2>

<p>Talks introduce each theme on the schedule, rooting our program in community experience and values, and sending us into collaborative sessions ready to dig in. We’ve asked speakers to challenge how we think, because solutions to systemic problems aren’t going to come from the ways we’ve approached journalism in the past. <a href="/talks">See the list of speakers and talks coming to SRCCON:WORK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-our-sessions">About Our Sessions</h2>

<p>Sessions at SRCCON events are highly collaborative: an opportunity to compare notes, share skills, and take advantage of every attendee’s expertise. We learn best when we learn from each other, and we want you to share ideas and start projects that live on beyond this event. <a href="/sessions">See the list of sessions at SRCCON:WORK</a>.</p>
