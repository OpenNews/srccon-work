            <h2 class="leader">If we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work.</h2>

<p>SRCCON:WORK is a brand new event for 2017, a small conference that digs deeply into how we as a community take care of each other and take on the hard work of journalism. It builds on the collaborative, peer-driven conference SRCCON, where over four years we have brought hundreds of members of the news-code community together for hands-on sessions exploring the cultural and technical ideas that push journalism forward.</p>

<p>SRCCON:WORK recognizes that technical work is done by people, and supporting those people can have a transformative effect in newsrooms. This is not a conference about javascript or python, machine learning or mapping. It’s a conference for the human beings who use those tools, and who want to develop personal and organizational practices that help them make the most of their skills.</p>

<p>This is a conference about…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collaboration &amp; teamwork.</strong> Tech teams often end up in silos, but building relationships that amplify complementary skills can lead to code and stories that change readers’ lives. Let’s share strategies that help us manage and mentor each other, and develop happy, functional teams that communicate and coordinate across newsrooms.</li>
  <li><strong>Hiring &amp; career growth.</strong> We have so much to learn about onboarding new colleagues and helping technical journalists build meaningful careers. We can’t give our communities the coverage they deserve without bringing in diverse, skilled voices and making newsrooms a place they want to stay.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental health &amp; self-care.</strong> We’re living in tough times for journalism right now, and that’s before we even talk about business models. Let’s talk about how to stay healthy—as individuals and as a community—so that even when the work gets hard, we don’t lose sight of the meaning we find in it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when--where">When &amp; where</h2>

<p>December 7-8 in Philadelphia, at the Chemical Heritage Foundation (site of SRCCON 2014).</p>

<h2 id="how-will-it-work">How will it work?</h2>

<p>SRCCON:WORK is a two-day conference for about 100 people. We’ll gather everyone in the same room for a series of focused talks, each followed by a set of smaller discussions and workshops that build on the topics they raise.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New journalists,</strong> whether you’re fresh out of school or just joined a newsroom from another field. Why do we work the way we do, and what needs to change? How do you keep from burning out when you’re on deadline all the time, and oh no the website just went down? What does a career in journalism actually look like?</li>
  <li><strong>People at a career crossroads.</strong> When the work is at its hardest, how do you make sure you and your colleagues stay healthy? If you love code or data or design, what happens when management seems like the only pathway to career growth?</li>
  <li><strong>Technical managers.</strong> How do you lead a team that’s responsible for both tech and journalism? How do you get your own managers to listen, and bring change to an organization that needs it?</li>
  <li><strong>People on small teams.</strong> Does your organization’s business model create a different set of pressures? How do you do the work when you don’t have (m/any) colleagues to turn to for support?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>Tickets will be $195.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>We’ll open a call for proposals on Wednesday, Sept. 6, and work with you to build a program that answers needs throughout our community.
