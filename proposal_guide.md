There are a lot of ways to think about sessions at SRCCON:WORK. We've put this guide together to help you turn your great idea into an equally great session proposal.

## What Are SRCCON:WORK Sessions Like?

SRCCON:WORK and our summer conference, SRCCON, are different than many other conferences you may have attended. They're highly participatory events, with a program built on collaborative, small-group sessions where facilitators and attendees take on conversations and projects as peers. When you run a session at SRCCON, you're in a room with dozens of other smart people with an opportunity to compare notes, share skills, and help everyone learn from each other.

We created SRCCON:WORK with a few principles in mind that lay the groundwork for our program as a whole:

* SRCCON:WORK is built around participation, discussion, and collaborative problem-solving.
* SRCCON:WORK exists to respond to the needs and interests of our community, and we're intentional in including perspectives from throughout the field.
* Every attendee is a peer—no special status, no outsiders.

Our sessions inhabit these values in different ways, through structured discussions and problem-solving groups; peer-to-peer workshops; even games, drawing, or field trips. We avoid traditional lectures and classroom-style trainings, but we welcome your creativity across a range of hands-on and collaborative session styles.

<span id="themes"></span>

## Our Themes for SRCCON:WORK

SRCCON:WORK will explore how newsroom teams can take care of each other, represent our readers, and give our communities the coverage they deserve. Some of the biggest problems keeping us from our best work aren't technical, so we're inviting proposals on three important themes:

* **Collaboration & teamwork.** Tech teams often end up in silos, but building relationships that amplify complementary skills can lead to code and stories that change readers’ lives. Let’s share strategies that help us manage and mentor each other, and develop happy, functional teams that communicate and coordinate across newsrooms.
* **Hiring & career growth.** We have so much to learn about onboarding new colleagues and helping technical journalists build meaningful careers. We can’t give our communities the coverage they deserve without bringing in diverse, skilled voices and making newsrooms a place they want to stay.
* **Mental health & self-care.** We’re living in tough times for journalism right now, and that’s before we even talk about business models. Let’s talk about how to stay healthy—as individuals and as a community—so that even when the work gets hard, we don’t lose sight of the meaning we find in it.

We'll be looking for sessions that take on one or more of these themes. When you submit a proposal, we'll ask you how you envision your session fitting into the program.

## Key Dates in the Proposal Process

* **September 18:** call for proposals closes at 11:59pm ET
* **September 27:** all proposers notified about status of their sessions

<span id="how-we-choose"></span>

## How We Choose Sessions for SRCCON:WORK

Our goal is to build a conference schedule with a mix of focused discussions, documentation and project work, and sessions that exist somewhere in between. As the SRCCON:WORK team reviews proposals, we'll look for:

* topics that are relevant to people new to newsrooms (or interested in working with them), technical managers who lead editorial and product teams, and journalists at pivotal moments in their careers
* a session description that shows you've thought through your time with attendees
* thoughts about what you'd like participants to take away from your session

After the call for proposals closes, we set aside two weeks for session review. Our priority is to build a balanced program that reflects the entire community, and we actively welcome session proposals from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology, and from non-coastal and small-market news organizations.

<span id="facilitator-tickets"></span>

## Tickets for Facilitators

We do not provide free tickets for session facilitators, but we do reserve tickets for them to purchase before attendee sales. Why do we do it this way? SRCCON:WORK is a collaborative, peer-to-peer event, and we consider all attendees to be active participants, not just speakers or passive audience members. This approach also helps us keep ticket prices low enough to be affordable for most news organizations.

<span id="great-session-proposal"></span>

## What Makes a Great Session Proposal?

As you propose an idea for SRCCON:WORK, your session description is the first opportunity to tell us how you'll spend time your time with everyone else who's excited about the same topic. We anticipate our sessions lasting about an hour, which can be plenty of time to dig into a topic—but it does go faster than you think! Even though SRCCON:WORK is a conversational conference, a sketch of the ground you hope to cover is a great indicator of the thought you're putting into a session.

Effective sessions are about effort and preparation more than expertise. We encourage you to describe how you'll share what you know, the types of great questions you'll pose, and the ways you'll help people learn something new. We find that the most promising proposals:

* take on a subject, or a slice of a subject, that can be realistically covered in about an hour
* provide a clear and inviting description of the session
* describe a clear outcome—what people should leave with

Other qualities that help a proposal stand out:

* session ideas that might not work as well at a traditional conference
* creative formats that support learning or sharing
* plans to help attendees learn new techniques or technologies, or upgrade their skills
* plans to help attendees build a peer group, engaging with other perspectives from people doing the same work

Successful sessions often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet others have dealt with it, too. If we see a number of pitches on the same subject, we'll work hard to make sure it's represented on the schedule. Sometimes we'll even suggest that proposers consider joining up to lead a session together.

## What Makes a Great Session Plan?

SRCCON:WORK is a new event this year, but to give you a taste of how facilitators at SRCCON have turned plans into action, here are a few writeups on hosting sessions:

* [3 Ways To Facilitate A Great Conference Session](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-facilitator-recs-one/), by ProPublica’s Sisi Wei
* [How We Facilitated A Huge, Participatory, Highly Charged SRCCON Session](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-facilitator-recs-two/), by NPR’s Alyson Hurt
* [OMGWTFBBQ: The Workshop](https://stephyiu.com/2016/08/01/omgwtfbbq-the-workshop/), by Automattic's Steph Yiu

As we get closer to SRCCON:WORK, we'll publish a facilitator guide similar to this one, with more details and advice on leading sessions.

<span id="cofacilitators"></span>

## Pitching With a Co-Facilitator

A co-facilitator for your SRCCON:WORK session can share the load of preparation and facilitation, as well as the fun of participating in the conference itself. If you're comfortable leading a session by yourself, that's great too!

Only one person needs to fill out the proposal form, and we'll follow up with any co-facilitators to verify their information as well. Feel free to work on the proposal together, but don't limit yourself to pitching with someone who can fill out the form sitting alongside you.

We consider solo and team proposals alike. But if you feel like your session could benefit from a co-facilitator, we encourage you to consider pitching with someone from another organization, and/or with a different background from your own.

<span id="session-formats"></span>

## Session Formats That Work

SRCCON:WORK is a genuinely participatory event, and it's great to start thinking about the format for your session now, and include detail in your proposal. It's totally OK if you plan to set up a session with an intro and a few slides, or to use examples throughout to support learning, but we do look for pitches that include real interactivity. We want our final program to include both conversational sessions, where people can dig into questions or problems in a way they can't at larger conferences, and project-driven work, where groups can work together to develop new resources for the community to learn from. Outstanding session formats in previous years have included:

* design exercises
* roundtable conversations
* games
* technical workshops
* small-group breakouts
* physical movement and field trips

We're always interested in new ideas, too, so feel free to propose something we've never imagined!

It's also useful to think about information and activity density and, again, the takeaways you want attendees to leave with. Over-programming a session with too many activities can make it impossible to get to your goals—but a session that's underdesigned can easily turn into a conversation between a handful of the loudest people. We're happy to help proposers figure out the right balance, and we don't expect you to have all the answers at the pitch stage, but it's good to start planning early. (When in doubt, narrow your scope.)

<span id="example-sessions"></span>

## Some Example Sessions from SRCCON

Again, SRCCON:WORK is a new event this year, but these examples from previous SRCCONs can help give you a picture of how we think about participatory sessions and topics:

* [True Life: I Work Remotely](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-remote-work). This was an excellent peer-to-peer experience sharing session that allowed both remotees and the remote-curious to learn from each other.
* [Let's All Be Terrible at Things Together](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-lets-be-terrible). This session forced people out of their comfort zones and into collaborating around weaknesses and fears.
* [Every day I’m juggling: Managing managers, peer expectations, and your own project ideas](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/#_session-juggling-expectations). Talking to management, helping them to see things from your perspective, coaxing change out of newsrooms--it's tough to go it alone. This session used the "experts in the room" to help level each other up.
