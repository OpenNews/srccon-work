## We received your form!

Thanks for telling us about your interest in SRCCON:WORK and/or submitting a scholarship application. Do you have a colleague who would be interested in or benefit from this conference? Please tell them about the conference! We hugely appreciate help reaching beyond our own networks, and personal recommendations really help new folks find out about our events and bring more people into the community.

After the form closes on October 18, we will review all of the submissions and notify everyone in mid- to late October. We will also inform folks about their scholarship application.

We’ve also just emailed you with all these details and a copy of your entry, so check your inbox—and your spam filters!
