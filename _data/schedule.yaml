They enjoy a historical continuity going back decades if not a century. Take the Metro Desk: It may take on new roles and responsibilities, and rethink a lot of their coverage, but the basic workings of the department are, for the most part, inherited. And when one Metro editor leaves, another takes her place and operates in a pretty similar way. \n\nBut that's not how things work for hybrid newsroom teams, like the ones that integrate data, images, graphics, video and code. There's no set of established guidelines for being their editor -- for elevating their work or for making sure they get to do the great journalism they should be doing. Many new editors need to figure things out for themselves.\n\nAnd when leaders leave, innovative newsroom teams are often victims of restructuring and destructive “reconceptualizations.” The fact is, the Metro desk doesn’t need to worry that it will be disbanded because its editor leaves. The news apps and visuals teams do.\n\nLet’s talk about how to start something new -- and how to make it forever:\n\n* How to bootstrap and then keep building a team.  \n* How to manage up to executives and out to other departments.  \n* How to develop allies so you know about projects that need you before you see them published.  \n* How to teach and evangelize your team’s culture and working style to more traditional editors and reporters.  \n* How to set long-term goals for the work and share them with your staff.  \n* How to support members on your team who work outside your discipline.  \n* For non-managers, how to measure the political winds, how to set yourself up to move up, and what to expect from your manager and your newsroom.  \n \nNone of us knows all the answers. This is all a work in progress. Let's learn from each other here so we don't keep repeating this process from scratch. This is a conversation for managers, for people who want to be managers, and for people who'd like to be managed well.",

The intern hiring process: the best processes to hire interns. Where to look for candidates, whether or not to pre-send interview questions, if reviewers should use rubrics and why sending intern feedback may take time but is imperative for growth. 2.) The internship: let's encourage interns to get the most out of their time with us. Should we do a pre-interview, make a work plan and/or pre-plan professional opportunities? 3.) The future: why these practices could define your future workforce. If we invest in making our interns diverse and well-equipt for the workforce, we could potentially invest in a more diverse and robust newsroom. Additionally, these practices aren't just for interns—some can be applied to the process for full-time hires as well. These are just some of the things I'd like to discuss in my session about the importance of intern-hiring and how it could change the future of a company, and moreover, the future of an individual who might have otherwise not had an opportunity like this.",

Or have you ever been in the middle of a conversation with a colleague from another department and realized they misinterpreted what you had been trying to convey? You’re not alone. \n\nOne of the impacts that technology has had on the news business is the rapid, chaotic expansion of the vocabulary needed to collaborate, be successful and thrive in the digital era. Editors, product managers, technologists, and others often come into conversations representing different cultures and using different words to describe what they do. That can be alienating to others, and slow down conversations about strategy or collaboration. For example: \nDid the OKR team hit their KPIs?\nAre you on Polymer yet?\nHow many sources do you have on background?\nWhat part of the funnel will that target?\n\nLearn how to navigate this complicated new landscape of vocabulary words while we play a few rounds of news organization Balderdash, a “board game of bluffing” where we each attempt to define the terms our colleagues are using in the office, and see how often we hit the mark. \n\nWe’ll leave time for brainstorming about ways to improve conversations among colleagues from a variety of backgrounds. \n\nFeel free to add your own terms or phrases before the session, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118mKhxDNHx6GB_K-YSH6ZIgdSTTQxybAMrxUbgPCNBA/edit#gid=2014690918\">here</a>.
