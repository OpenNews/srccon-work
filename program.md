### Talks

SRCCON:WORK work will focus on careers, teamwork, and care, and how these themes intersect in making journalism more inclusive and responsive. Each section of our schedule will begin with a pair of 10-minute talks that push us to do the hard work it takes to make newsrooms better.

This is a small conference, and we want to take advantage of that intimacy with moments where we share an experience as a full audience. We've invited talks driven by our community's experience and values. We want them to challenge us as a group, then send us into breakout sessions full of new ideas. Here are the [talks we've confirmed so far](/talks).

### Sessions

The SRCCON:WORK schedule is also participatory at its core, through hands-on sessions that dig into our conference themes. These sessions are proposed and led by community members ready to lead conversations and develop new resources we can all learn from. 

Sessions at SRCCON events are different than those at most conferences. This part of the program is highly collaborative: an opportunity to compare notes, share skills, and take advantage of every attendee's expertise. We'll be taking part in:

- discussions that help us learn from each other, and leave full of ideas that can transform the way we work.
- sessions where we work together to make something that lives on beyond this event, from shareable guidelines and best practices to lesson outlines that attendees can take back to their own newsrooms.
