<p class="safety"><b>SRCCON SAFETY HELPLINE:</b> If you would like any support after the event, please email us at <b><a href="mailto:srccon@opennews.org">srccon@opennews.org</a></b>.</p>

The spirit of generosity that animates this community is a big part of what lead to SRCCON and this version of SRCCON in particular. We heard again and again that folks wanted to have space to share with and support one another. We know we're going to be tackling some challenging topics over these two days, so we wanted to share some reminders about making sure you can take care of yourself, while you take care of each other.

## Taking care of yourself
* **"Put on your mask first before assisting others."** It's advice many of us may set aside in our daily life. For these two days, we want you to be able to put yourself and your needs first.
* **Listen to yourself.** We've created a schedule and brought in a lot of snacks and drinks so if you're body is telling you something, you can find that sustenance, breath mint, or more. We encourage you to listen to other needs you may have too--feeling an urge to stretch? Feeling your neck tense up? Want to go for an impromptu walk? Do it. Garden 2 is also available as a quiet room if you need a space to decompress.
* **You do not need to ask permission to meet your own needs.** With this event, we have "the rule of mobility:" if you aren’t participating in a session, or no longer want to participate, you can and should go elsewhere to a session where you can contribute. You don't have to ask or apologize or delay. Just get up and go.
* **You have support, we are here for you.** You're likely to find folks who are facing similar challenges and are available to strategize or distract, if that's what you need. You can lean on this community and network. You are not in this work alone. If you need someone to talk to, the [support team](#team) is here for anyone who—for any reason—would like to take a moment to process something that comes up anytime during our program.

## Taking care of each other
We hope you're feeling an openness to taking care of your own needs as the priority here. We hope with your own feeling of care and nourishment, that will also open up space to take care of each other as well.

* **Hear others.** As you build your comfort with listening to yourself, you have a chance to listen more deeply to other folks a well. To hear what they're expressing within what they are saying. To recognize invitations and boundaries that allow us to better connect with one another.
* **Respect boundaries.** We will be dealing with difficult topics and that means that we need to be even more intentional than ever to make everyone is safe and comfortable so we may all bring out our true and best selves. If someone wants or needs to stop a line of conversation, respect their wishes. And remember, following the law of mobility includes respecting when others do the same.
* **We all have support.** The entire event is backed by [our code of conduct and safety plan](/conduct). It helps us take care of each other, and respond when necessary.

## Inviting others into your conversation

When telling us why y’all wanted to come to SRCCON:WORK, many of y’all told us you wanted to meet others who were also working on making change in your newsrooms and teams. 

* Say hi! **we are here to meet and learn from one another.** See a group of folks you barely know that sound like they’re having an intersting conversation? Join in!
* **Keep space open for others to join.** Follow Eric Holscher’s [Pac-man rule](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/): “When standing as a group of people, always leave room for 1 person to join your group.” 

## Disclosures

As an event on community and care, you might want to discuss intimate, sensitive or distressing topics. But please keep in mind two basic principles of disclosure:
    
* SRCCON:WORK is a space to support one another and our support team is available when you need a moment to reflect, but aren’t equipped to help you process through trauma. Please seek professional care if you need help with acute distress.
* Please take care with your personal disclosures. You can apply the “dinner party rule”: if you wouldn’t disclose something to friendly strangers over a meal, think carefully before deciding to disclose it at SRCCON:WORK.

If you feel that another SRCCON:WORK attendee is inappropriately relying on other attendees for emotional or mental health support, please contact an OpenNews organizer (we are in blue t-shirts).

## The Support Team

We will have a support team on call if—for any reason—you would like to take a moment to process something that comes up anytime during the conference. You can find anyone wearing a SRCCON:WORK t-shirt or text the safety helpline (<b>(612) 584-1131</b>, it is also on the back of your conference badge) and a support team member will come find you.

Both the support and safety team are available all day Thursday, through the evening, and until closing on Friday. While we are not equipped to be your therapist, we are here for you.
