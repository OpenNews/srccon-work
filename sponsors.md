        <h3>SRCCON:WORK Lead Sponsor</h3>
        <p>At the News Lab, we strongly believe in the importance of quality journalism—original, fact-based reporting that spreads knowledge and has the power to improve people’s lives—and the journalists who produce it. We believe in Google's capacity to be a positive force in helping journalists strengthen digital storytelling and produce more in-depth reporting. And, we see ourselves as the voice for journalism inside Google—to ensure that the interests, needs, and concerns of journalists are surfaced and reflected in the products and services we offer as a company.</p>

        <h3>SRCCON:WORK Diversity Scholarship Sponsor</h3>
        <p>The News Integrity Initiative at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism is a project to improve people’s lives by building trust in journalism, combating disinformation, and nurturing constructive, inclusive and respectful public conversations.</p>
        <p>Through grants, applied research, events and workshops, we provide support for journalism that listens, responds to, and meaningfully reflects the needs and goals of the communities it serves. Our vision is for people to feel powerful — to feel visible, valued, and engaged in their communities — because they are armed with news and information that strengthens their sense of ownership and opportunities in the places where they live and work, empowers them to participate in community decision-making, and deepens their understanding of and empathy for people of all backgrounds and experiences.</p>
