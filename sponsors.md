SRCCON:WORK is a brand new event for 2017, a small conference with a program that digs deeply into how we as a community take care of each other and take on the hard work of journalism. It builds on the collaborative, peer-driven conference SRCCON, where over four years we have brought hundreds of members of the news-code community together for hands-on sessions exploring the cultural and technical ideas that push journalism forward. Our events attract the best newsroom developers, designers, and data analysts for two days of thinking, working, and building together.

Sponsors help us make SRCCON:WORK unique and accessible by keeping our ticket price well below cost, getting people to the event, and bringing in the special touches that make SRCCONâ€¦ SRCCON.

We offer several levels of sponsorship in order to accommodate a variety of sizes of companies and organizations. Below you'll see some of our recent offerings. These may evolve as we plan for this brand new event, but this will give you an idea of the type of sponsorships we offer.
